(A 3 hour coding challenge)
-------------------------

USAGE:
  * Open index.html in your favorite (preferably modern) web browser, or
  * Navigate to the URL above

UX TODOs:
  * Prompt the user before starting on page load
  * Let the user select difficulty rating

DEV TODOs:
  * Further componentization of the code
  * Possibly use a module loader to use different files
    * Feels perhaps too heavy for this?
